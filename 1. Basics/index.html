Library and framework both provide pre written code and functionalities but framework is fully independent but 
library is not.

React js:
React is a javascript libraray maintained and developed by Facebook. Used to create single page application and provide us 
rich ui interface.


Components/Features of React js:
- Virtual DOM
- Components
- JSX
- One Way data minning



SWC (Speedy Web Compiler)

- Commands:
npm create vite


npm - (Node pakage manager)
npx - (Node pakage executor)


File name in  src in asset is in capital letter like ( Components.jsx )




definition of Components:
- Component is a reusable piece of code returns a part of ui.


*There are two types of Component
1. Functional Component
2. Class Component



1.Functional Component:
-When we write a simple javascript function in a Component and it return some value.

2.Class Component :
- When we write ES6 classes (oops) in a Component.
-Class component have all the features of react js like state,props,life cycle methods and all but functional component does not have those initially.

-In react 16.8 hooks were introduced which provide all the features of react in functional component.


There are three life cycle stages :-

-Mounting -> Creation of a componenet

-Updating -> Updation of a component

-Unmounting -> Completion of a component





Life Cycle Methods in Class Component

-componentDidMount()

-componentDidUpdate()

-componentWillUnmount()




Life cycle Method in Functional Component

There is a hook called useEffect()




State in React:
- State refers to a javascript object that holds data specific to a componenet, which can change over time and influence the component's rendering.
-State is accessed by -> this.state



*When page load it is known as render.
*When it reload again than it is known as rerendering 


Props in react:
-Props stands for properties used to pass data from parent to child component this is a fundamental concept of react js.
-It follows one way flow like it flows from parent to child 









Module:
- This are user defined file and block of code which we can import and export.


JSX :
- Javascript XML 
- It allows us to write html with javascript together.
- It is represented through {}.







-Hooks
-Hooks allows us to use react feature in functional component all this features natively available in class component.
Hooks were introduced in react 16.8 version 
Example: state, ref and life cycle methods

1.usestate
- usestate is a important hook used to manage state in functional component. It takes one state variable and a functional update 
It cause re-render on updatation



2.useEffect
-This is a important hook used to perform side effects in functional component like data fetching and api calling.

-We can also perform life cycle methods in functional component using useEffect hook.


3.useRef:
- This is a hook used to create mutable reference with DOM elements and it does not cause re-render. 



*DIFFERNCE BETWEEN usestate AND useRef: (for me)



Keys:
Keys are special string attribute that you must include when creating lists of elements in React. They help React efficiently identify which items
in a list have changed, been added, or been removed.


Fragments:
- React Fragments are a feature in react that allow you to group multiple elements returened by a components render method without adding an extra
node to the DOM.

When we remove div and there is only <> </> this is known as Fragments.



Controlled Components:
In a controlled component, the form data is handled by the React component's state. The state is the single source of truth for the input's value.
-useState



Uncontrolled Components:
In an uncontrolled component, the form data is handled by the DOM itself, similar to traditional HTML forms. React does not actively manage the input's value.
-useRef



-Higher Order Component in React:
A Higher-Order Component (HOC) in React is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component with enhanced functionality 
or modified behavior. It is a pattern for reusing component logic and achieving separation of concerns.
